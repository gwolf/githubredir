<h1>Githubredir</h1>

<p>Delivering .tar.gz from Github tags</p>

<h1>Github is obsolete and will go away!</h1>
<p>Please note that <b>githubredir is nowadays considered to be
obsolete</b>. Github now provides a clean way to query for the
tags: A human-facing interface:</p>
<p><tt>https://github.com/<em>author</em>/<em>project</em>/tags</tt></p>
<p>And a more machine-oriented interface:</p>
<p><tt>https://api.github.com/repos/<em>author</em>/<em>project</em>/tags</tt></p>
<p>A suitable <tt>debian/watch</tt> for this project would be:</p>
<p><tt>version=3<br/>
opts="filenamemangle=s/(?:.*)?v?(\d[\d\.]*)\.tar\.gz/<em>project</em>-$1.tar.gz/"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/<em>author</em>/<em>project</em>/tags (?:.*/)?v?(\d[\d\.]*)\.tar\.gz</tt></p>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>There is quite a bit of software whose upstream authors decide that,
as they are already using Git for development, the main distribution
channel should be <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> - This
allows, yes, for quite a bit of flexibility, which many authors have
taken advantage of.</p>

<p>Specifically, what does this redirector make? Given that GitHub
allows for downloading as a .zip or as a .tar.gz any given commit, it
suddenly becomes enough to <tt>git tag</tt> with a version number, and
GitHub magically makes that version available for download. Which is
sweet!</p>

<p>Sometimes it is a bit problematic, though, to follow their
format. Github gives a listing of the tags for each particular
prooject, and each of those tags has a download page, with both
archiving formats.</p>

<p>I won't go into too much detail here - Thing is, going over several
pages becomes painful for Debian's <a
href="http://dehs.alioth.debian.org/uscan.html">uscan</a>, widely used
for various of our QA processes. There are other implemented
redirectors, such as the one used for SourceForge.</p>

<h3>Who should use this</h3>

<p>This redirector is mainly meant to be consumed by uscan. Anybody
who finds this system useful can freely use it, although you might be
better served by the rich, official <a
href="https://www.github.com">GitHub.com</a> interface. If source code
is your thing, <a href="/githubredir.rb">grab the source here</a>.</p>

<h3>How to use this?</h3>

<p>Get the GitHub <em>project name</em> and the <em>author</em> you
want to follow. And just create a simple URL:</p>

<blockquote><tt>http://githubredir.debian.net/github/<em>author</em>/<em>project</em>/</tt></blockquote>

<p>That means, if you want to track, say, <tt>mislav</tt>'s excellent
<tt>will_paginate</tt> Ruby library:</p>

<blockquote><tt><a
href="http://githubredir.debian.net/github/mislav/will_paginate">http://githubredir.debian.net/github/mislav/will_paginate</a></tt></blockquote>

<form action="http://githubredir.debian.net/githubredir.cgi">
<p>Or you can use this oh-so-very-handy form, to play with the tool:<br/>
<b>Author:</b> <input name="author" type="text" size="20" /><br/>
<b>Project name:</b> <input name="project" type="text" size="20" /><br/>
<input type="submit" value="Check for tags" /></p>
</form>

<p>But, of course, you want to include it in your
<tt>debian/watch</tt>, right? Ok, so, again for Mislav's
will_paginate: </p>
<pre>version=3
http://githubredir.debian.net/github/mislav/will_paginate/ (.*).tar.gz</pre>

<p>Please note tags can follow just about any format - I am using
<tt>(.*)</tt> as a simple pattern. You might need some more stuff if
the project's author is more... Baroque? :-}</p>

<h3>Bugs, to-do, etc.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes, when requesting a specific tar.gz, GitHub just
  returns a 404	error. I believe this to be GitHub's fault, not mine,
  as it works upon a retry... But anyway.</li>
  <li>This script allows for tracking a single user's repository for a
  given project. This is usually what you want - However, it would be
  good to also link to the project's forks, if available. Now, this
  is to be machine-consumed, so... I'm not sure this would be
  useful.</li> 
</ul>
